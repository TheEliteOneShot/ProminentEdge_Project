# ProminentEdge_Project

A full stack web template I've created from scratch on (7/2/2023) to solve a future problem.

# Installation for Windows

- Install NPM [https://nodejs.org/en/download]
- Install Python [https://www.python.org/downloads] (This app was tested on python version 3.10.3)

# Startup instructions

- Run **start_backend.ps1** to start up the backend server. This will start the flask app and initialize the database.
- Run **start_frontend.ps1** to start up the frontend server. This will start the frontend Vue server. Follow the localhost link to the web page when the script has finished.
